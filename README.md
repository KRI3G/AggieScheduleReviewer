## Inspiration
We all had trouble signing up for classes, torn between overestimating and underestimating ourselves. So we decided to help future students with this conondrum.
## What it does
It takes an input PDF and then scrapes RateMyProfessor and Anex.US to pull data on professors, then displays it to the user, as well as an AI review of the schedule.
## How we built it
We used NodeJS, with most of our data being stored in JSON objects. For the front end, its vanilla HTML and CSS.
## Challenges we ran into
Many many challenges - CSS was difficult to work with, async functions in nodeJS were causing part of the script to pull from JSON before it was loaded by another part, the AI response was hallucinating, and much more. However, as a team, we powered through, and made it work.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The UI looks very clean, and the script overall is incredibly fast, to where we had to slow the responses so it was easier to read.
## What we learned
We all learned a lot - how async works, how JS reads JSON objects, and how to work with a team through GIT.
## What's next for Aggie Schedule REViewer
We realized after brainstorming that this is a legitamely helpful project, and we are considering fleshing it out to work for Galveston students, as well as perhaps giving alternative classes.
